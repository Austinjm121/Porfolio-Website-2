# Porfolio-Website-2
Challenge Module 02


## Deployed Website
[https://austinjm121.github.io/Porfolio-Website-2/]


## Problems I ran into
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary> 
  
- Getting the bar inbetween the three "sections" to be shared.
  
- I couldn't figure out how to stack the text. IE: About ontop of me and contact ontop of me.
  
- I couldnt figure out how to make the cards formatted so perfectly within the website like on the example.
  
- Had a hard time moving the text on the picture, as it had some sort of weird margin/padding issue.
